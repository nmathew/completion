# Goals

This project aims to implement an editor and language agnostic backend with the initial
scope of supporting:

* Code completion
* Going to definitions/implementations
* Going to the documentation

The project was born out of a growing frustration with the badly architectured Sublime Text
code completion plugins [SublimeClang](https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeClang),
[SublimeJava](https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeJava) and
[CompleteSharp](https://github.com/quarnster/CompleteSharp). Either large code rewrites
would have to be made or the code had to be written from scratch to amend their
weaknesses. I decided to go with the latter approach.

[Go](http://golang.org/) was chosen as the one language to rule them all because put
simply, it has rocked my socks off and continue to do so as I discover more about it.
It's a joy to work with and its expressiveness, yet simplicity results in beautiful
code that reads like a haiku.

Collaborators wanting to aid the project are welcome to submit pull requests and/or
open up a new issue number for discussing implementation details not already discussed
in the [existing issues](https://github.com/quarnster/completion/issues?state=open) list.
